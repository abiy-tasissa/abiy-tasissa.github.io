<li> <p>In compressive sensing, the measurement matrix is assumed to satisfy some conditions. These are usually stated using the notion of coherence or RIP. This brief <a href="coherence_rip.pdf" target="_blank">note</a> shows in detail how the two measures are related. </p>

<p> From June 19-23, 2017, I participated in Mathematical Problems in Industry workshop held at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I was part of a team that worked on the mathematical modeling of 
the scheduling of advertisements during television shows. Under the excellent mentorship of
Professor Peter Kramer, this was a very rewarding experience. 
The final report can be found <a href="report_clypd_17.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

<p> I was fortunate to take a graduate course "Introduction to Numerical Methods"
	from Prof. Steven Johnson at MIT. My final project for the class was Remez algorithm. Given
	a function \(f\), under certain condition, Remez algorithm gives a polynomial or rational function
	that "best" approximates it. The report <a href="remez.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> in detail 
    discusses the Remez algorithm. </p>

In Fall 2014, I took a graduate course in solid mechanics at Harvard where I learned a lot from
very enjoyable lectures by Professor Vlassak. My final presentation was on Hu-Washizu-Debeveque functional. This is a variational framework to derive the equations of linear elasticity. 
The presentation can be found <a href="es240finalpr.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

My first research experience was in the Nuclear Engineering Department at MIT. I learned
a lot about research under my mentor Professor Michael Driscoll. The project was on
assessing the effectiveness of a proposed fuel assembly for Sodium cooled fast reactors.
The report can be found <a href="report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p></li>

<h3>Video</h3>
<p>
For the ESG X Program at MIT, I did an introductory lecture video, for a general audience,
about the wave equation under Galilean transformation. The idea was to use ideas from
multivariable class and motivate Lorentz transformation and special relativity. 
The video can be found  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIsuMMnhpp4&t=7s" target="_blank">here.
