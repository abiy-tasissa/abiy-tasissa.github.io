<p>Welcome to my page! I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://math.tufts.edu/"> Department of Mathematics </a> at Tufts University. </p>

<p>
	My current research interests are distance geometry, matrix completion, compressive sensing and structured dictionary learning. I am also interested in the application of these topics to structure prediction, signal processing and machine learning. In addition to these areas, I maintain a broad interest in applied mathematics and have also worked in problems in gas dynamics and shock waves. 
 </p>

<p> My research is partially supported by National Science Foundation grant <a href = "https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2208392&HistoricalAwards=false">[NSF DMS 2304489].</a><p>

<p>I am looking for motivated students with a strong mathematical background. Please email me if you are interested in my research.  </p>
